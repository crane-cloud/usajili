# usajili - A custom public and private image registry

A multi-cluster storage for major public images (popular applications such as mySQL) locally hosted but also allows users to create, upload and manage their own images. Users may mark their images as public but will be subject to a security audit to ensure the images don't contravene client and platform security.
